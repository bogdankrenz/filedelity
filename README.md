# File Converter CLI

Fun little project to create a CLI tool that converts common file types

- DOC(X) <-> PDF
- TIFF <-> JPG
- MOV <->  MP4
(Optional) Image resizing

The goal is to create a CLI tool which has multiple options to convert different files.
Either have a guided conversion, where you submit answers to given prompts and at the end choose the files to convert, or
just use a command to convert the file to a wanted format

For example: 
```
   conv pdf word test.pdf  
```
Converts a pdf file into word to the same path the pdf file currently exists
